# Web server in Python

**Little WEB server developed in Python
Allowing a client with a web browser to access files and pictures from the server files.**

To launch the software you must execute server_http.py

Default port is 8000, and default directory is html/
You can change them in config_srv.py


Things to upgrade:
- Videos support

Test to add:
- Get more pages with link in between
- I developed a lot of functions to access the configuration safely, and I don't use them in the server code yet
- Images on the page
